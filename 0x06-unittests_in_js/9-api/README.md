# Intermediate API Testing

## Overview

This directory showcases more advanced API testing techniques, building upon the basics established in the previous 8-api directory. It includes a more complex API structure and corresponding test cases.

## Files

- `api.js`: Enhanced API implementation with multiple endpoints.
- `api.test.js`: Comprehensive test suite covering various API scenarios.
- `package.json`: Project configuration and dependencies.

## Setup and Execution

1. Install required packages:

```
npm install
```

2. Execute the test suite:

```
npm test
```

## Key Features

- Multiple API endpoints with different functionalities
- Parameter validation and error handling
- Test cases for both successful and error scenarios

## Learning Objectives

- Implement more complex API structures
- Write robust test cases for various API behaviors
- Understand the importance of edge case testing in APIs
