# Full Server Directory

This directory contains the core server files for the Node.js project.

## Files

- **`controllers/`**: Directory containing controller files that handle incoming requests and business logic.
- **`routes/`**: Directory containing route files that define the API endpoints.
- **`server.js`**: The main server file that initializes and configures the Express application.
- **`utils.js`**: Utility functions used across the application.

## Running the Server

To start the server, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will run the server with the `nodemon` tool, allowing for automatic restarts on code changes.
