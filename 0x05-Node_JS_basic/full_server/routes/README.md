# Routes Directory

This directory contains the routing files for the Student Management System API.

## Files

- **`index.js`**: Defines the main routing logic and sets up the API endpoints for the application.

## Route Definitions

The `index.js` file typically:
- Imports necessary controllers
- Defines API endpoints
- Maps endpoints to controller methods

## Usage

Routes defined here are imported and used in the main `server.js` file to set up the Express application's routing.

To add new routes:
1. Define the new route in `index.js`
2. Map it to the appropriate controller method
3. Ensure the corresponding controller method is implemented
